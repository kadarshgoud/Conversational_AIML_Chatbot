<pattern>SANITISER</pattern>
<template>Disinfectants are chemical agents designed to inactivate or destroy microorganisms on inert surfaces. Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacterial spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical or chemical process that kills all types of life.</template>

<pattern>SPACE</pattern>
<template>Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</template>

<pattern>MICROORGANISM</pattern>
<template>A microorganism, or microbe, is a microscopic organism, which may exist in its single-celled form or a colony of cells.
The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, such as in Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India.</template>
